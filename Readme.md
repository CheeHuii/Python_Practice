I studied CS, I know some programming.

This year is the second year I working as a Graduate Trainee in a tech MnC.

While I able to deliver what was expected, I still struggle with the fundamentals.

This repo is for me to practice Python.

All resources comes from online.

Everyone welcomed to use it.

Please remind me to practice.
